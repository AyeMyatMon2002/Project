    <h1>Hi, I am git</h1>
    <p>Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes 
        in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers
         to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting
         each other’s work. Git records changes in a project’s history,
         enabling users to revert to earlier versions, compare updates, and 
         collaborate efficiently. Its features like branching, merging, and 
         remote repositories (like GitHub or GitLab) make it a powerful tool
         for managing both small and large software projects.</p>
